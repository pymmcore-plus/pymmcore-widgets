# Contributing

Thanks for thinking of a way to help improve this library!

Remember that contributions come in all shapes and sizes beyond writing bug fixes.
Contributing to documentation, opening new
[issues](https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/pymmcore-widgets/issues) for bugs, asking
for clarification on things you find unclear or requesting new features, are
all super valuable contributions.
