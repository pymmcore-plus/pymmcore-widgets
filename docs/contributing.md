# Contributing

Thanks for thinking of a way to help improve this library!

Remember that contributions come in all shapes and sizes beyond writing bug fixes. Contributing to documentation, opening new issues for bugs, asking for clarification on things you find unclear or requesting new features, are
all super valuable contributions.

You can do any of the above by opening a new [issues](https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/pymmcore-widgets/issues) or by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/pymmcore-widgets/pulls) on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/pymmcore-widgets) for this project.
