# Contributing

Thanks for thinking of a way to help improve this library! Remember that
contributions come in all shapes and sizes beyond writing bug fixes.
Contributing to [documentation](#contributing-documentation), opening new
[issues](https://github.com/pymmcore-plus/pymmcore-widgets/issues) for bugs, asking
for clarification on things you find unclear or requesting new features, are
all super valuable contributions.

## Contributing Documentation

Our documentation is built with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) from the files
in the `docs` folder. To build docs locally:

```shell
# install docs dependencies
pip install -e ".[docs]"

# build docs and serve locally
mkdocs serve
```

The docs should be live at <http://127.0.0.1:8000> and will update automatically
as you edit and save them.
