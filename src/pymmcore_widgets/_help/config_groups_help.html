    <h1>Configuration Groups and Presets</h1>

    <p>
      Micro-Manager lets you bundle hardware settings into
      <a
        href="https://micro-manager.org/Micro-Manager_User%27s_Guide#controlling-devices"
        ><strong>Groups of Configuration Presets</strong></a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each <strong>Group</strong> contains named <strong>Presets</strong> that
      define a set of <strong>Device Property values</strong> to be applied to
      the hardware.
    </p>

    <h2>Typical Workflow</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Add a configuration group</strong> (e.g. "Channel") using the
        <em>Add Group</em> button at the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add a preset to the group</strong> (e.g. "DAPI"), by selecting
        the group and clicking the <em>Add Preset</em> button.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Select device properties to include in the preset</strong> (e.g.
        "Filter Wheel Position", "Light Source Power") using the device property
        selector at the right.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Set the device properties to desired values</strong> for the
        currently selected preset in the Presets Table at the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Repeat steps 2-4 to add more presets to the group</strong> (e.g.
        "FITC", "Cy3", "Cy5"). You may <em>Duplicate</em> an existing preset to
        copy its device property values if another preset is similar.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Key Building Blocks</h2>

    <h3>1. Devices</h3>
    <p>
      Physical hardware (camera, filter wheel, stage, light source). Each device
      exposes one or more <strong>properties</strong> that can be changed or
      read.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Device Properties</h3>
    <p>
      A single adjustable parameter on a device (e.g.
      <code>Exposure</code>, <code>Position</code>).
    </p>

    <h3>3. Configuration Presets</h3>
    <p>
      A preset is a snapshot of <em>specific</em> values for a set of device
      <strong>properties</strong>. Activating a preset sets each device property
      to its stored value.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you might have a <em>FITC</em> preset that sets the
      appropriate filter wheel positions and light sources for imaging the FITC
      channel.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Configuration Groups</h3>
    <p>
      A configuration group is a <strong>collection of presets</strong>. It is
      customary (<em>but not mandatory</em>) for each preset in a group to share
      the same set of device properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you might have a <em>Channel</em> group that includes presets
      for each optical configuration preset (<em>DAPI</em>, <em>FITC</em>,
      <em>Cy3</em>, <em>Cy5</em>).
